Description: Aims to utilize model-based clustering (unsupervised)
        for high dimensional and ultra large data, especially in a distributed
        manner. The code employs 'pbdMPI' to perform a
        expectation-gathering-maximization algorithm
        for finite mixture Gaussian
        models. The unstructured dispersion matrices are assumed in the
        Gaussian models. The implementation is default in the single program
        multiple data programming model. The code can be executed
        through 'pbdMPI' and MPI' implementations such as 'OpenMPI'
        and 'MPICH'.
