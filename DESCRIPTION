Description: The pmclust aims to utilize model-based clustering (unsupervised)
        for high dimensional and ultra large data, especially in a distributed
        manner. The package employs Rmpi to perform a
        expectation-gathering-maximization (EGM) algorithm
        for finite mixture Gaussian
        models. The unstructured dispersion matrices are assumed in the Gaussian
        models. The implementation is default in the single program multiple
        data (SPMD) programming model. The code can be executed through Rmpi and
        independent to most MPI applications. See the High Performance
        Statistical Computing (HPSC) website for more information, documents
        and examples.
